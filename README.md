**Are you ready to embark on a journey to learn JavaScript in no time and build something fun and interactive?** In this blog, I'll guide you through creating a simple get Meme app *(inspired by Joan Cornella’s art)* using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs and Bootstrap. - *Beginner friendly.*

- Search for [Public APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis?tab=readme-ov-file#animals) and choose interested one (e.g. food recipes, city maps, memes). Research the possibility and complexity through YouTube video tutorials, Web3 and GitHub. Next, search for UX and UI inspiration on Instagram or TikTok.
- Sketch the ideas on paper and prototype them on paper, Canva or Figma
- Learn how to [blog on Notion](https://www.notion.so/help/guides) and discover [Notion shortcuts](https://www.notion.so/help/keyboard-shortcuts)
- Learn JavaScript, JSON files and Public APIs through a calendar schedule below
- Install Bootstrap
- Create a GitHub repository
- Publish on GitHub and Notion

*To build a strong foundation in HTML, CSS and JS, consider investing 2-3 months of consistent learning.* **Anyway, let’s get started!**
